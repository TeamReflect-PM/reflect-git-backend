    "journal_text": "Today was a mixed bag. Morning sprint planning kept circling back to the same blockers, which frustrated me, but I took a midday run and the endorphins reset my mood. Called Mom in the evening and that lifted me — she told me to rest before the demo. Logged notes in the app about talking points for the presentation and a checklist for the demo fallback. Ending the day hopeful but careful: I’ll prepare the simplified demo path Priya suggested and sleep early tonight."
